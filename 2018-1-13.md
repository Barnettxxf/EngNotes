## Crawler for buying 12306 rails tickets

1.finished two function parts of ScrambleTickets

I came up against a problem that while I used *json.loads(html.read().decode())*, python raise error saying that 'Unexpected UTF-8 BOM (decoding utf-8-sig)'. After search in *baidu*, I found the answer. parameter of *loads* function contains BOM characters, and it can solve the problem like this :

~~~python
if text.startswith('\ufeff'):
    text = text.encode()[3:].decode()
text = loads(text)
~~~
