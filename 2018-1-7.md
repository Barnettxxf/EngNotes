###### *Conclusion*:

That's it! We reached the end of our exercise.

Throughout this kernel we put in practice many of the strategies proposed by Hair et al. (2013). **We philosophied about the variables, we analysed 'SalePrice' alone and with the most correlated variables, we dealt with missing data and outliers, we tested some of the fundamental statistical assumptions and we even transformed categorial variables into dummy variables.** That's a lot of work that Python helped us make easier.

But the quest is not over. Remember that our story stopped in the Facebook research. Now it's time to give a call to 'SalePrice' and invite her to dinner. Try to predict her behaviour. Do you think she's a girl that enjoys regularized linear regression approaches? Or do you think she prefers ensemble methods? Or maybe something else?

It's up to you to find out.
