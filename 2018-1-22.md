### Pit of installation for MongoDB

> There are two parts for installation for MongoDB. One is itself installation and its configuration. I refer to the Blog which works(*link:https://www.cnblogs.com/xuanmanstein/p/7991589.html*). Creating file'logs' is as important as the file 'data'. The other part is Visualization Tools for MongoDB and there are a lot of options for it, such as MongoDB Compass, MongoChef, 3Tmongochef, NoSQL Manager for MongoDB Professional,  rockmongo, Mongo Management Studio, Robomongo. However, the above instances are not fit for me because of the slow network...After I try one by one, 'dbKora' and 'Mongo Plugin' are both successfully installed on my laptop, hiahiahia~(*refers link:https://www.zhihu.com/question/31903748*)
