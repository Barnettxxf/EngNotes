### Docker Installation

> ~~~bash
> $ sudo apt-get update
> $ sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

> $ sudo apt-ke fingerprint 0EBFCD88
>

### Docker Usage

> We must run docker with root privilege,  which means we should use it like this:
>
> ~~~bash
> $ sudo docker COMMAND
>
> # Some common commands
> # run a image "scrapinghub/splash" in the backgroud
> $ sudo docker run -d -p 8050:8050 scrapinghub/splash
> # show us running image infomation, where we can the image name
> $ sudo docker ps 
> # stop image "scrapinghub/splash" by its name
> $ sudo docker stop pedantic_feynman
> # we can also start an image by its name too, if you remember it.
> $ sudo docker start pedantic_feynman
>
> # PS: When we code a script to run docker, we must face with the problem that we cannot input password after sudo command like the terminal device.How to solve it? Command 'sudo' provides a parameter -S, which can read the password from standard input instead of using ther terminal device. There is a sample:
> $ echo 'password' | sudo docker start pedantic_feynman
> ~~~
